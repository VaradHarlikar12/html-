            Junk food refers to food that is highly processed,
             typically high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and salt, and low in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber. While junk food can be convenient, tasty, and cheap, it can have several harmful effects on the body when consumed regularly or in large quantities. 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Weight Gain and Obesity</li>
            <p>High in Calories: Junk food is often very calorie-dense but lacks the nutritional value needed for maintaining a healthy weight. Items like chips, sodas, fast food, and pastries are loaded with calories that can quickly lead to overeating without providing satiety (feeling of fullness).
                <br>Low in Nutrients: While high in calories, junk food tends to be low in fiber, protein, and healthy fats, meaning it doesnâ€™t keep you full for long, leading to overeating and weight gain.
                <br>Sugar and Fat: The high sugar and fat content in junk foods leads to insulin spikes and fat storage, which can contribute to obesity over time.
                </p>
            <li>Increased Risk of Heart Disease</li>
            <p>Trans Fats and Saturated Fats: Many junk foods are rich in unhealthy fats, especially trans fats and saturated fats, which can raise levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol in the blood. This can contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries, leading to heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.
               <br> High Salt (Sodium): Excessive sodium intake from processed foods can cause high blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
                <br>Inflammation: Diets high in processed foods have been linked to increased inflammation, which can damage blood vessels and lead to cardiovascular problems.
               </p>
            <li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
            <p>
                Insulin Resistance: Frequent consumption of junk food, especially foods high in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, can cause the body to develop insulin resistance. This means the cells no longer respond properly to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels and eventually type 2 diabetes.
                <br>Blood Sugar Spikes: Junk foods, particularly those with added sugars, cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels followed by a crash, which can create a cycle of cravings and overeating, further promoting insulin resistance</p>
            <li>Digestive Issues</li>
            <p>Lack of Fiber: Many junk foods are highly processed and stripped of fiber, which is essential for healthy digestion. Without fiber, the digestive system slows down, leading to constipation and other gastrointestinal problems.
                <br>Gut Health: A diet high in processed foods can negatively affect the balance of gut bacteria, potentially leading to digestive disorders, inflammation, and even an increased risk of certain diseases like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p>
