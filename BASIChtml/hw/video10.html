            <h4>FOOTBALL</h4>
            <p>Football (also known as soccer in some countries like the United States and Canada) is a popular team
                sport played worldwide. It involves two teams of 11 players each, competing to score goals by getting a
                ball into the opposing team's net. The team that scores the most goals during the match wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>1. Objective of the Game:
                The main goal in football is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent's net.
                The team that scores the most goals during the match wins.
                If the game is tied at the end of regular time, a draw or extra time may occur, depending on the
                competition rules.
                <br>2. The Field:
                A football field (also known as a pitch) is rectangular, typically around 100-110 meters long and 64-75
                meters wide.
                The field is divided into two halves, with a center circle, penalty area, and goal area.
                Each end of the field has a goal: a rectangular structure with a net, 7.32 meters wide and 2.44 meters
                high.
               <br>b 3. The Ball:
                A football is a round ball typically made of leather or other synthetic materials, with a circumference
                of 68-70 cm and weighing between 410-450 grams.
                <br>4. The Basic Rules:
                Duration: A football match lasts 90 minutes, divided into two 45-minute halves, with a break in between.
                Kick-off: The match starts with a kick-off from the center of the field, and teams switch sides at
                halftime.
                Offside: A player is considered offside if they are closer to the opponent's goal line than both the
                ball and the second-last defender when the ball is played to them. Offside results in a free kick for
                the opponent.
                Fouls: Players must avoid physical fouls (e.g., pushing, tripping) and playing the ball unfairly (e.g.,
                handball). Violations are punished with free kicks or penalty kicks.
                Free Kicks: A free kick is awarded after a foul, and there are two types:
                Direct Free Kick: A goal can be scored directly from the kick.
                Indirect Free Kick: The ball must touch another player before a goal can be scored.
                Penalties: A penalty kick is awarded when a serious foul is committed inside the penalty area. It is
                taken from the penalty spot, 11 meters from the goal line, with only the goalkeeper defending.
                Yellow and Red Cards: A yellow card is a warning for a player who commits a minor foul, while a red card
                means the player is sent off for a serious foul or misconduct.
               <br>b 5. The Teams:
                Team Composition: Each team has 11 players, including:
                1 Goalkeeper: The only player allowed to use their hands to defend the goal area.
                Defenders: Players who primarily focus on stopping the opposition from scoring.
                Midfielders: Players who connect defense and attack, controlling the flow of the game.
                Forwards: Players whose primary role is to score goals.
                Substitutions are allowed, typically 3 per team during regular play, but this may vary by competition.
               <br> 6. Scoring:
                A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and beneath the
                crossbar.
                A goal is worth one point.
               <br>b 7. Key Competitions:

                teams.
               <br> 8. Common Positions:
                Goalkeeper: Defends the goal and is the only player allowed to handle the ball inside the penalty area.
                Defenders: Usually positioned near the goal to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Types include

                the pace of the game.
                Forwards/Strikers: Their main job is to score goals. They play near the opponent's goal and often rely
                on assists from midfielders.

            <h4>CRICKET</h4>
            <p>
                Cricket is one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world, especially in countries like
                India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.</p>
            <p>
                Teams: Cricket is played between two teams, each typically consisting of 11 players.
                Innings: Each team bats and bowls in one or more innings, depending on the format of the game. In an
                innings, one team bats while the other bowls and fields.
                Overs: A standard over consists of 6 legal balls bowled in succession. The bowler cannot bowl more than
                one over in a row. The number of overs in an innings varies by format (e.g., 20 overs in T20, 50 overs
                in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and unlimited overs in Test matches).
                Pitch: The game is played on a rectangular pitch, typically 22 yards (20.12 meters) long, where the
                bowler bowls, and the batsman hits.
                Boundary: The outer edge of the playing field is marked by a boundary line. If the ball crosses the
                boundary without touching the ground, it counts as six runs. If the ball touches the ground first, it
                counts as four runs.
                Wickets: Each end of the pitch has a set of wickets, which consists of three stumps and two bails on
                top. The batsman tries to protect the wicket from being hit by the ball.
                <br>
                1. The Basics of Play:
                Bowling: The bowler's job is to deliver the ball to the batsman in a way that tries to get them out
                (dismiss them). A bowler delivers the ball in a variety of ways:
                Fast Bowling: A bowler delivers the ball at a high speed.
                Spin Bowling: A bowler spins the ball to deceive the batsman.
                Batting: The batsman’s goal is to hit the ball and score runs. They can score runs by:
                Running between the wickets after hitting the ball.
                Hitting the ball to the boundary (either four or six runs).
                Fielding: The fielding team's goal is to stop the batsman from scoring runs and get them out by catching
                the ball, running them out, or hitting the stumps.
                <br>
                2. Types of Dismissals (Ways a Batsman Can Be Out):
                Bowled: The bowler hits the stumps with the ball, and the bails fall off.
                Caught: The batsman hits the ball, and the ball is caught by a fielder, wicketkeeper, or bowler before
                it touches the ground.
                Leg Before Wicket (LBW): If the ball hits the batsman's legs in line with the stumps and would have hit
                the stumps, they are out.
                Run Out: The batsman is outside their crease when the stumps are broken by a fielder’s throw or direct
                hit.
                Stumped: The wicketkeeper removes the bails while the batsman is out of their crease and not attempting
                a run.
                <br>3. The Formats of the Game:
                Cricket has three main formats, which differ in the number of overs and the duration of the game:

                Test Cricket: Played over 5 days, each team has two innings. It is the longest form and is known for its
                strategy and patience.
                One Day Internationals (ODIs): Each team gets 50 overs to bat, and the match is completed in a single
                day.
                T20 (Twenty20): A shorter format where each team bats for just 20 overs. This is a fast-paced, exciting
                form of the game.
               <br> 4. The Key Roles in a Cricket Team:
                Batsmen: Players who specialize in batting. They try to score as many runs as possible and defend their
                wicket.
                Bowlers: Players who specialize in bowling. They aim to dismiss the batsman and restrict the runs.
                All-rounders: Players who are good at both batting and bowling. They provide balance to the team.
                Wicketkeeper: A specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps to catch balls that the batsman misses.
                The wicketkeeper also stumps or runs out players.
                Fielders: The remaining players are fielders, who are spread across the field to prevent runs and
                attempt to dismiss the batsman.
                <br>5. Basic Cricket Terms:
                Over: A set of six balls bowled by the same bowler.
                Crease: The lines on the pitch that the batsman and bowler must respect. The batsman must be inside the
                crease when they face the bowler.
                Duck: A term used when a batsman gets out without scoring any runs.
                Century: A batsman scores 100 or more runs in an inning.
                Hat-trick: When a bowler takes three wickets in consecutive balls.
                <br>6. Scoring:
                Run: A basic unit of scoring in cricket. Batsmen score runs by running between the wickets or hitting
                the ball to the boundary.
                Four: A boundary scored when the ball hits the ground before crossing the boundary.
                Six: A boundary scored when the ball crosses the boundary without touching the ground.
                <br>7. Common Cricket Equipment:
                Bat: A flat wooden bat, typically made from willow, used by the batsman to hit the ball.
                Ball: A hard ball made of cork and leather, used to bowl and hit.
