learning gits new things

to go back to an commit i need to just :
git log 
git reset copy the specific location i want to go back to 
//only problem is that when i travel back to the last commit all those commits between will also be unstaged


git stash:so basically what it does is that it keep it at the back.
i can use this like when i want to keep the unstaged changes meaning like changes 
i will apply but right now they should be away from the code

git pop:used to pop out the stash area work 
git stash clear: this will erase all the changes on the back meaning 
i can't access it anymore
